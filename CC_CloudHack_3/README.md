# CloudHack_3

We chose to implement two functionalities as mentioned by the project guidelines. 
1)Lowest Common Multiple
2)Exponent
We then ventured into the unknown and created a functionality to calculate the binomail coefficeint x C y. 
This is used very commonly for permutations and combinations
3)Binomial Coefficient
